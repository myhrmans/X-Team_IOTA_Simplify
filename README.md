## ðŸŒ³ IOTA Simplify Initiative

The **IOTA Simplify Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the IOTA Community by introducing IOTA to the broader audience with easy to understand content, graphics and open source contributions.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) among each other for zero fees.

## ðŸŽ¯ Initiative Goals

The IOTA Simplify X-Team is a 100% community driven initiative. We are currently focused on improving the IOTA Experience around the following goals:

- Engagement
- Outreach
- Reduced overhead in communication
- Market adoption

### Engagement

Engagement goal includes making sure that the newcomers to the IOTA project can find resources to engage with the IOTA Community to understand IOTA with the goal to get started with IOTA for their purposes.

 > - [X] [IOTA Discord Channel Reorganization (A)](https://github.com/iota-community/X-Team_IOTA_Simplify/issues/1)

### Outreach

Outreach goal includes everything related to writing, curating, and sharing content around to increase knowledge and positive sentiment about IOTA in other communities. Resolve misconceptions, old FUD and spread joy with memes.

### Reduced overhead in communication

Goals here are to simplify the idea of IOTA and Tangle, spread the good word and attract more average Janes and Joes to the ecosystem. Establish resources that allow newcomers to quickly access information regardless of their level of understaning about the underlying technology, concepts, and economics of the Tangle, the token, and the IOTA Foundation itself. 

> - [ ] [Make "What is IOTA?" understandable by the layman (B)](https://github.com/iota-community/X-Team_IOTA_Simplify/issues/3)

###  Market adoption

Market adoption goal includes business-friendly information ready to be shared and discussed. 


## ðŸ¤” How Can You Get Involved?

Show your interest by adding your information with an issue here on github and join the IOTA Experience Team on the [IOTA Discord](https://discord.iota.org).

## ðŸ‘¥ What to expect?

Meet with IOTA Foundation members to exchange ideas, give and receive feedback for the chosen goal(s).

This initiative is possible thanks to the contribution of the IOTA Community members and participants will be invited to participate in feedback collecting and evaluating sessions to further push the capabilities of the IOTA Experience Teams.
